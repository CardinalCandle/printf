# printf Implementation in C

## Overview
This repository contains a collaborative project to develop a custom implementation of the printf function in C. Our implementation features advanced formatting options and optimized performance.

## Technologies and Skills Used
- C
- Algorithms
- Memory management
- Teamwork
- Agile methodologies

## Usage
To use our printf implementation in your own project, simply include the header file `main.h` and call the function as you would with the standard printf function.
```
#include "main.h"

int main() {
    _printf("Hello, World!\n");
    return 0;
}
```
